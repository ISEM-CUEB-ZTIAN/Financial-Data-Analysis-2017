* The Volatility of Asset Returns

This lecture focuses on the volatility of asset returns. Here
volatility refers to the *conditional variance* of a time series. That
is, for a return series {$r_t$}, we are now interested in 
\[\sigma^2_t = \var(r_t \mid F_{t-1})\]
where $F_{t-1}$ is the information set at time $t-1$. 

** Characteristics of volatility

In practice, we have observed some stylized facts about volatility,
and some volatility models are proposed to characterize them. These
properties of volatility include:

1. There exist volatility clusters. That is, volatility may be high
   for certain time periods and low for other periods. Figure
   [[fig:nyse-us-100]] shows the daily changes in the log of the NYSE
   U.S. 100 stock price index. As seen, a cluster of tranquil periods
   from 2003 to 2007 is followed by a cluster of drastic volatile
   periods from 2008 to 2010.

2. Volatility evolves over time in a continuous manner. That is,
   volatility jumps are rare. In Figure [[fig:realgdp]], the change of the
   volatility of the annualized real GDP growth rate of the U.S. is
   relatively smooth.

3. Volatility does not diverge to infinity. That is, volatility varies
   within some fixed range. Statistically speaking, this means that
   volatility is often stationary.

4. Volatility seems to react differently to a big price increase or a
   big price drop, referred to as the leverage effect. 

   
* TODO The Structure of a Volatility Model

** DONE The basic idea of building a volatility model
CLOSED: [2017-04-13 Thu 16:15]

Consider the log return series {$r_t$}. The basic idea of a volatility
model is that {$r_t$} may appear to be either serially uncorrelated or
serially correlated with a minor order, but {$r_t$} is a dependent
series and the dependence arises from its conditional variance.

 For illustration, consider the monthly log stock returns of Intel
 Corporation from January 1973 to December 2008 shown in Figure
 [[fig:intel-return]]. 

 Figure [[fig:acf-intel-return]] displays the sample ACF and PACF of the
 log return. 
 - Figure [[fig:acf-intel-return]](a) shows the sample ACF of the log
   return series {$r_t$}, which suggests no significant serial correlations
   except for a minor one at lag 7. 
 - Figure [[fig:acf-intel-return]](b) shows the sample ACF of the squared log returns
   {$r^2_t$}. 
 - Figure  [[fig:acf-intel-return]](c) shows the sample ACF of the absolute log returns,

 These two plots clearly suggest that the monthly log returns are not
 serially independent. Combining the three plots, it seems that the
 log returns are indeed serially uncorrelated but
 dependent. Volatility models attempt to capture such dependence in
 the return series.
