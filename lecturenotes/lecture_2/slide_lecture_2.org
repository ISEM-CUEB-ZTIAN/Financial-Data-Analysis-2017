* The Volatility of Asset Returns

** Volatility is measured with the conditional variance

- Volatility here refers to the *conditional variance* of a time series.

- For a return series {$r_t$}, we are now interested in 
  \[\sigma^2_t = \var(r_t \mid F_{t-1})\]
  where $F_{t-1}$ is the information set at time $t-1$. 

** Characteristics of volatility (1)

1. *There exist volatility clusters.* That is, volatility may be high
   for certain time periods and low for other periods.

** Characteristics of volatility (2)

2. Volatility evolves over time in a continuous manner. That is,
   volatility jumps are rare.

** Characteristics of volatility (3)

3. Volatility does not diverge to infinity. That is, volatility varies
   within some fixed range. Statistically speaking, this means that
   volatility is often stationary.

4. Volatility seems to react differently to a big price increase or a
   big price drop, referred to as the leverage effect. 
   
* The Structure of a Volatility Model

** The basic idea of building a volatility model

Consider the log return series {$r_t$}. The basic idea of a volatility
model is 
- {$r_t$} may appear to be either serially uncorrelated or
  serially correlated with a minor order. 
- However, {$r_t$} is a dependent series and the dependence arises
  from its conditional variance.

** Decompose $r_t$ into the mean and variance equations

To capture the dependence in a time series through its second moment
but not the mean, we model the mean process and the variance process
separately. 

For a return series {$r_t$}, we can model it as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mean-plus-var}
r_t = \mu_t + a_t
\end{equation}
where $\mu_t$ represents the conditional mean and $a_t$ is
modeled to capture the conditional variance.

** The mean equation

\begin{align}
&\mu_t = E(r_t \mid F_{t-1}) = \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i y_{t-i} - \sum_{i=1}^q \theta_i a_{t-i} \label{eq:mean-equation} \\
&y_t = r_t - \phi_0 - \sum_{i=1}^k \beta_i x_{it} \nonumber
\end{align}
$F_{t-1}$ is the information set at time $t-1$. 

\vspace{0.5cm}

If you combine these two equations, and let $\mu_t = r_t - a_t$, you
will find that it is just an ARMA$(p, q)$ model with additional
regressors $x_{it}$.

** The variance equation

Denote the conditional variance of $r_t$ with $\sigma^2_t$.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\sigma^2_t = \var(r_t \mid F_{t-1}) &= E\left( (r_t - E(r_t | F_{t-1}))^2 | F_{t-1} \right) \\
&= E\left( (r_t - \mu_t)^2 \mid F_{t-1} \right) \\
&= \var(a_t \mid F_{t-1})
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

** The variance equation (cont'd)

- If we assume that $E(a_t \mid F_{t-1}) = 0$, we can see that
  $\sigma^2_t = E(a^2_t \mid F_{t-1})$. 

  \vspace{0.3cm}

  This result motivates us to use
  the series of {$a^2_t$} to model the conditional variance
  $\sigma^2_t$. 

- The simplest model is a linear model, like the following
  \[ \sigma^2_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 a^2_{t-1} + \cdots + \alpha_m a^2_{t-m} \]

- Let $a^2_t = \sigma^2_t + \nu_t$ where $\nu_t$ is a white noise
  series. The above equation turns into an AR$(m)$ model for {$a^2_t$}
  as follows
  \[a^2_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 a^2_{t-1} + \cdots + \alpha_m
  a^2_{t-m} + \nu_t \]
  This equation represents the essential idea of an ARCH model with just
  a little modification. 

** The procedure of building a volatility model

Building a volatility model for an asset return series consists of
four steps:

1. Specify a mean equation by testing for serial dependence in the
   data and, if necessary, building an econometric model (e.g., an
   ARMA model) for the return series to remove any linear dependence.

3. Use the squared residuals of the mean equation to test for ARCH
   effects.

4. Specify a volatility model if ARCH effects are statistically
   significant, and perform a joint estimation of the mean and
   volatility equations.

5. Check the fitted model carefully and refine it if necessary.

** Testing for the presence of ARCH effect

*** The Ljung-Box test for the series of $a^2_t$

Upon obtaining the residuals from the estimation
of an adequate mean equation, we can use the squared residuals
{$\hat{a}_t^2$} to test the existence of autocorrelation. 
- The Ljung-Box test is used to test the null hypothesis
  $H_0: \rho_1 = \cdots = \rho_m = 0$.
- The $Q(m)$ statistic is
  calculated and compared with the critical value from $\chi^2(m)$
  distribution at the desired significance level.
- The rejection of the
  null hypothesis implies that there is autoregressive conditional
  heteroskedastic (ARCH) effect. 

** The LM test

*** An auxiliary regression
We estimate a AR$(m)$ model regarding {$\hat{a}^2_t$}, that is,
\[ \hat{a}^2_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \hat{a}_{t-1}^2 + \cdots +
\alpha_m \hat{a}^2_{t-m} + e_t \]

*** The LM test
With this model, we test the joint hypothesis
\[H_0: \alpha_1 = \cdots = \alpha_m = 0 \]
- The LM statistic is $NR^2$ where $N$ is the sample size of this
  regression and $R^2$ is the coefficient of the determination of this
  regression. 
- Given the null hypothesis is true, this statistic follows
  a $\chi^2(m)$ distribution. 

** The LM test (cont'd)

Alternatively, we can use F statistic to test the joint
hypothesis. 
- Let $SSR_0 = \sum_{t=m+1}^{T} (\hat{a}^2_{t} -
  \bar{\omega})^2$, where $\bar{\omega} = (1/T) \sum_{t=1}^T
  \hat{a}^2_t$.
- Let $SSR_1 = \sum_{t=m+1}^T \hat{e}^2_t$ where $\hat{e}_t$ is the
  residuals from the regression. 
- The F statistic is
  \[F = \frac{(SSR_0 - SSR_1)/m}{SSR_1/(T-2m-1)} \sim F(m, T-2m-1)\]
- Rejecting the null hypothesis motivates us to model the possible
  ARCH effect.

** An example

Go back to Figure [[fig:acf-intel-return]]. Since the return series is
already stationary, we directly test the squared return series to
check the ARCH effect. 

- In the LM test of the ARCH effect, $F = 53.62$ and the p value is
  close to zero.
- The Ljungâ€“Box statistics of the $a^2_t$ series also
  shows strong ARCH effects with $Q(12) = 89.85$, the p value of which is
  close to zero.
- Therefore, we can confirm that the return series of
  Intel stock has an ARCH effect, and next we need to model such an
  effect.
